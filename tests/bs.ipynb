Prompts should stay under 400 characters, and longer, specific descriptions tend to work best. Prompt engineering is a skill that needs to be learned and developed. To improve the neural network's performance, one should focus on creating compelling text and image prompts, optimizing image quality, and using long-term memory. Mistakes to avoid when creating DALL-E 2 prompts include avoiding complicated prompts, using specific prompts for more reliable images, and providing clear instructions. Successful DALL-E 2 prompts include getting specific about the style, talking about every little element in the image, and sharing successful ways the AI was able to generate the image. User feedback is used to improve the AI text-to-image model, train with human feedback, improve safety and alignment, and incorporate multi-modal experiences into applications.\")"
