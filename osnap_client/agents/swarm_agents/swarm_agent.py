        Clarification on the event loops. Bear with me here =)
        Ideally we'd like the adapter and the agent to run in the same event loop,
        but both the discord process and the adent process are blocking the event loop.

        So we need to split the process into two event loops, one for the agent and one for the adapter.

        However, now we cannot await the adapter methods from the agent, because they are running in different event loops.
        Therefore in the agent we need to use the run_coroutine_threadsafe method to run the adapter methods in the adapter event loop.
