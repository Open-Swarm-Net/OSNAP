#- treat the swarm manager as another bot that uses a discord adapter
#- task map
- some tasks depend on the results of other tasks
- 'who' parsing by individual bots
- only bot->task queue -> bot communication allowed (no bot-bot)
- task id and status tracking on the manager
- health check
- swarm manager database abstraction: data  models, abstracted db engine

- use case: generating a marketing image
-- user -> ping bot ($ping cute cat)
==> ping bot creates a task with subtasks to research image generation and another task to prompt image generation
