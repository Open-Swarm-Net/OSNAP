## Autonomous AI agent prompt and response tracing

This tool is designed to trace the responses of automous AI agents, to facilitate improved initial prompting, constraint settings and tooling. Currently, it supports the [LoopGPT](https://loopgpt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.

Note: This is just the frontend client. The backend client is in this repo: https://github.com/iskandarreza/loopgpt-mongodb-express/tree/add-ui

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Start client:

```
yarn start
```

### Still in development!

## TODO:

1. Config initial states on the frontend
2. Option to save state to disk/db
3. Option to save logs to disk/db
