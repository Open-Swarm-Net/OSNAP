# RFC: Specification of the Open Swarm Network Agent Protocol (OSNAP)

## Introduction

This RFC proposes a specification for the Open Swarm Network Agent Protocol (OSNAP), a standardized protocol for building autonomous AI agents and swarms or organizations of agents. The primary goal of OSNAP is to facilitate interoperability, collaboration, and ease of development across various autonomous AI systems, similar to how HTTP serves as a standard protocol for the World Wide Web.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the development and implementation of autonomous AI agents and swarms are highly fragmented, with different projects utilizing various custom-built protocols and communication methods. This lack of standardization can lead to difficulties in:

Interoperability between different AI systems and swarm implementations.
Reusability of code, components, and algorithms.
Collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the field of autonomous AI and swarm intelligence.
OSNAP aims to address these issues by providing a well-defined, standardized protocol for building and interacting with autonomous AI agents and swarms.

## Proposed Solution

The Open Swarm Network Agent Protocol (OSNAP) will be based on the following key components:

1. Agent Representation: A standardized format for representing autonomous AI agents, including their properties, behaviors, and capabilities.

2. Communication Protocol: A well-defined communication protocol that enables agents to exchange messages, coordinate actions, and collaborate with one another within a swarm or across different swarms.

3. Swarm Management: A set of standardized operations and interfaces for creating, modifying, and managing swarms or organizations of agents.

4. Security and Authentication: Mechanisms for ensuring secure communication, data privacy, and authentication between agents and swarms.

5. Interoperability and Extensibility: A modular design that allows for easy integration with existing AI systems, frameworks, and tools, as well as extensibility to support future developments in the field.

The proposed OSNAP specification will include detailed definitions and guidelines for each of these components, along with example implementations and use cases.

## Alternatives Considered

Adapting Existing Protocols: Adapting existing communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, XMPP) for use in autonomous AI and swarm systems. While these protocols provide a solid foundation, they may not fully address the specific requirements and challenges of autonomous AI agents and swarms.

Proprietary Protocols: Continuing to develop and rely on custom-built, proprietary protocols for individual projects. This approach can result in a lack of interoperability, code reusability, and collaboration opportunities, as well as increased development complexity.

## Backward Compatibility

OSNAP is designed to be a new standard for autonomous AI agents and swarms, and as such, it may not be directly compatible with existing systems using custom or proprietary protocols. However, the modular design and extensibility of OSNAP aim to facilitate the integration and migration of existing systems to the new protocol. Our intent is to eventually publish client libraries, and possibly wrappers for existing projects, to make it very easy to conform to the spec.

## Implementation Plan

1. Develop a detailed specification document for OSNAP, including definitions, guidelines, and examples for each of the key components.
2. Implement reference implementations and sample agents/swarms using the OSNAP specification.
3. Submit paper to ArXiv
4. Create documentation, tutorials, and other resources to assist developers in adopting and implementing OSNAP in their projects.
5. Collaborate with the broader AI and swarm intelligence community to gather feedback, refine the specification, and promote adoption of OSNAP.

Estimated timeline: 6-12 months

## Open Questions

1. What specific communication patterns and message types should be included in the OSNAP communication protocol?
2. How can OSNAP best support the wide range of use cases and applications for autonomous AI agents and swarms?
