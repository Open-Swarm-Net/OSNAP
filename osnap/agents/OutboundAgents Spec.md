# OutBoundAgent Specification

## 1. Introduction

The OutBoundAgent is an AI-driven agent designed to operate within a multi-agent system, performing tasks and providing information on behalf of users. This specification outlines the key features and requirements for the OutBoundAgent, ensuring compliance with the OSNAP, support for dynamic capabilities, and seamless integration with the agent network.

## 2. Key Features

The OutBoundAgent must satisfy the following key features:

1. Compliance with AIP: The agent must adhere to the communication protocol defined in the AIP, supporting capabilities_query and responding to requests that are advertised in its capabilities_query response.
2. Modular capabilities structure: The agent must have a modular architecture that allows capabilities to be added or removed as plugins, enabling easy customization and extensibility.
3. Continuous operation: The agent must be designed to run continuously, always ready to respond to incoming requests and pings from other agents in the system.
4. Network registration: The agent must register itself on the network to be discoverable by other agents, allowing seamless collaboration and task delegation.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Compliance with OSNAP

The OutBoundAgent must implement the OSNAP by supporting the following message types:

1. Capabilities Query: The agent must be able to process and respond to capabilities_query messages from other agents, providing information about its supported capabilities, tasks, and SLAs.

2. Request and Response: The agent must be able to process request messages for tasks and information advertised in its capabilities_query response, and provide appropriate response messages containing the requested information or task results.

### 3.2 Modular Capabilities Structure

The OutBoundAgent must have a modular architecture that supports the addition and removal of capabilities as plugins. Each plugin must:

1. Define the capability's name, description, and any associated SLAs.
2. Implement the functionality required for the capability, such as providing information, executing tasks, or interacting with external APIs or services.
3. Expose a standardized interface for the OutBoundAgent to interact with the plugin, allowing seamless integration with the agent's core functionality.

### 3.3 Continuous Operation

The OutBoundAgent must be designed to operate continuously, listening for incoming messages from other agents in the system. It must:

1. Implement a message processing loop that listens for and processes incoming messages.
2. Respond to pings from other agents to confirm its availability and presence on the network.
3. Handle failures gracefully, ensuring that temporary issues do not disrupt the agent's operation.

### 3.4 Network Registration

The OutBoundAgent must register itself on the agent network, making it discoverable by other agents. This registration process must:

1. Provide the agent's identifier, supported capabilities, and any relevant metadata to a central agent registry.
2. Periodically update the agent's registration information to ensure that it remains discoverable and its capabilities are accurately represented.
3. Implement a mechanism for deregistering the agent from the network, such as during shutdown or maintenance.

## 4. Conclusion

By adhering to this specification, the OutBoundAgent will be able to effectively collaborate with other agents in the system, supporting dynamic capabilities and seamless integration into the agent network. This design will enable the OutBoundAgent to be a flexible and extensible component within a multi-agent AI ecosystem.
