# How Swarms Work

## Swarm Membership

One of the main jobs of the swarm is to manage the swarm membership of Agents. It needs to support the following functionality: 

1. Agents can join the swarm 
2. Agents can leave the swarm
3. The swarm can remove agents, for example if they are unresponsive or otherwise harmful to the swarm
